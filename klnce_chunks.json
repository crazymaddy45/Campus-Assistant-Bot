Proper monitoring, mitigation techniques, and modern power conditioning technologies are essential tools in achieving this goal. HARMONIC AUDIT An Industrial Electrical Harmonic Audit involves the assessment and analysis of electrical systems in an industrial environment to identify, measure, and mitigate harmonic distortions. Harmonics are voltage or current distortions caused by non-linear loads, which can compromise power quality, reduce efficiency, and damage equipment. Objectives of a Harmonic Audit: Identify Harmonic Sources: Determine which devices or systems (e.g., variable frequency drives, rectifiers, or welding machines) are introducing harmonics. Measure Harmonic Levels: Quantify Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) for both current and voltage in the system",

Other Power Quality issues include Sag, Swell, Voltage Fluctuations etc. During the audit, sophisticated instruments such as Power Analyzer (Single phase and Three Phase), Harmonics Analyzer, Megger etc. are used by the Energy Auditors to carry out measurements of various electrical utilities. Analysis of electrical consumption is done based on these measurements. 3. Electricity Bills Further to this analysis of electricity bills, energy consumption trends, bench-marking in line with process requirement is also carried out. 4",

Our Work  Our Energy audits will evaluate your facility as a whole, to consider a wide range of available facilities (Electrical, Mechanical, Envelope and Water).  The audit will not only inform you of opportunities but provide you with financial analysis. This will enable prioritization based on financial benefit and return on investment.  Provide you with solid, easy to understand technical information regarding the proposed energy conservation measures.  A good quality audit will analyze your historical energy use and find potential issues using statistical methods.  Provide you with emissions analysis to help you understand the benefits of your decisions from an environmental standpoint",

PADLET Information Technology is an online Virtual Wall tool to express thoughts on topics of their choice. Students can access a questions board anytime and post their queries which can enable the mentor to read off and answer the questions each day. Assignments topics and tutorials are given to students through the option for which answers are gathered and discussions are carried on. Information Technology over all helps to summarize a large amount of information and present Information Technology in a visually pleasing way.

The following Pedagogy techniques have been followed by the faculty: Blended Learning: Study material (or) Video-Lectures are posted in students discussion forum. In a live class room, students may ask queries or faculty may give some assignment  quiz to assess their learning skills. Project Based Learning: Periodically, students are encouraged to participate in the project contest conducted by TNSI and TNSCST. They are allowed to attend Hackathon. Faculty members are acting as mentors for the students to guide in proper aspects. Deserved students in the final year are permitted to go for internship, to fulfill the gap between the curriculum and the industry need.

NPTEL is an acronym for National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning which is an initiative by seven Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT Bombay, Delhi, Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras and Roorkee) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc) for creating course contents in engineering and science. NPTEL as a project originated from many deliberations between IITs, Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) during the years 1999-2003. A proposal was jointly put forward by five IITs (Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur, Kharagpur and Madras) and IISc for creating contents for 100 courses as web based supplements and 100 complete video courses, for forty hours of duration per course. Web supplements were expected to cover materials that could be delivered in approximately forty hours",

Five engineering branches (Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical, Electronics and Communication and Mechanical) and core science programmes that all engineering students are required to take in their undergraduate engineering programme in India were chosen initially. Contents for the above courses were based on the model curriculum suggested by All India Council for Technical Education (All India Council for Technical Education) and the syllabi of major affiliating Universities in India. The basic objective of science and engineering education in India is to devise and guide reforms that will transform India into a strong and vibrant knowledge economy. In this context, the focus areas for NPTEL project have been i) higher education, ii) professional education, iii) distance education and iv) continuous and open learning, roughly in that order of preference",

Among these, the number of institutions having fully qualified and trained teachers in all disciplines being taught forms a small fraction. A majority of teachers are young and inexperienced and are undergraduate degree holders. Therefore, Information Technology is important for institutions like IITs, IISc, NITs and other leading Universities in India to disseminate teachinglearning content of high quality through all available media. NPTEL would be among the foremost and an important step in this direction and will use technology for dissemination. India needs many more teachers for effective implementation of higher education in professional courses. Therefore, methods for training young and inexperienced teachers to enable them carry out their academic responsibilities effectively are a must",
